## 1. Domain Model (Minimum Spec)

### Concepts

| Entity          | Role                                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project**     | Top-level collection of bundles                                        |
| **Bundle**      | A named group of cards within a project                                |
| **Card**        | Minimum unit of content; always belongs to one bundle                  |
| **Scope**       | Cross-project card collection; gathers any cards regardless of project |
| **WorkingCopy** | A workspace attached to a scope; new cards can be created from it      |
| **ScopeRel**    | Many-to-many join table linking scopes to gathered cards               |

### Hierarchy

```
Project
└── Bundle (project_id NOT NULL, cascade delete)
    └── Card (bundle_id NOT NULL, cascade delete)
        ├── workingCopyId (nullable, set null on wc delete)
        └── ScopeRel ──→ Scope
                              └── WorkingCopy (scope_id nullable, set null on scope delete)
```

### Delete behaviours

| Deleted     | Effect on children                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Project     | Cascade → Bundle → Card → ScopeRel                     |
| Bundle      | Cascade → Card → ScopeRel                              |
| Card        | Cascade → ScopeRel                                     |
| Scope       | `working_copy.scope_id` set null (orphan working copy) |
| WorkingCopy | `card.working_copy_id` set null (card retained)        |

### Card creation paths

1. **Plain card** — `addCard({ db, bundleId, content })` — no working copy association.
2. **Derived card** — `addCard({ db, bundleId, content, workingCopyId })` — created within a working copy context; the originating scope is traceable via `card → working_copy → scope`.

## 3. Type and Interface Relations

```
WithDB      = { db: DB }                         (api/types.ts)
WithProject = WithDB & { projectId: string }     (api/types.ts — used by bundle.ts)
WithBundle  = WithDB & { bundleId: string }      (api/types.ts — used by card.ts)
WithScope   = WithDB & { scopeId: string }       (api/types.ts — used by working-copy.ts, scope-rel.ts)

ScopeRelKey = WithScope & { cardId: string }     (scope-rel.ts — local)

Domain row types (InferSelectModel):
  Project, Bundle, Card, Scope, ScopeRel, WorkingCopy   (api/types.ts)

DB = typeof db   (client.ts — full LibSQLDatabase<schema>)
Tx = LibSQLDatabase<typeof schema>               (client.ts — transaction handle, lacks `batch`)
```

---

## 4. API Function Map

All functions follow `async fn({ db, ...params }): Promise<T>`.

| Module            | Functions                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project.ts`      | `listProjects`, `getProject`, `addProject`, `deleteProject`, `updateProjectName`                          |
| `bundle.ts`       | `listBundles`, `getBundle`, `addBundle`, `deleteBundle`, `updateBundleName`                               |
| `card.ts`         | `listCards`, `getCard`, `addCard`, `deleteCard`, `updateCardContent`                                      |
| `scope.ts`        | `listScopes`, `getScope`, `addScope`, `deleteScope`                                                       |
| `working-copy.ts` | `listWorkingCopies`, `listOrphanedWorkingCopies`, `listCardsWithOrphanedWorkingCopy`, `addWorkingCopy`, `getWorkingCopy`, `deleteWorkingCopy` |
| `scope-rel.ts`    | `listCardsByScope`, `addScopeRel` (idempotent), `removeScopeRel`                                          |
| `composite.ts`    | `createCardFromWorkingCopy` (transactional: addCard + auto addScopeRel)                                   |

---

## 5. Notable Design Patterns

### Access boundary on get/delete

`getBundle` and `deleteBundle` always filter by both `projectId` AND `bundleId`. Same for `getCard`/`deleteCard` with `bundleId`. This prevents horizontal privilege escalation via bare UUIDs.

### Soft-orphan on nullable FKs

`working_copy.scope_id` and `card.working_copy_id` are nullable with `onDelete: set null`. Rows are retained on parent deletion; `listOrphanedWorkingCopies` (filtering `isNull(scopeId)`) is the cleanup entry point.

### Idempotent many-to-many insert

`addScopeRel` uses `onConflictDoNothing()` — safe to call multiple times without error.

### Dependency injection via context object

The `db` handle is always passed explicitly as part of a `{ db, ...params }` argument. The singleton is never imported directly in API functions — they are all injectable and unit-testable without module mocking.

### Typed context hierarchy

Shared context types (`WithDB`, `WithProject`, `WithBundle`, `WithScope`) are defined centrally in `api/types.ts` and composed with intersection types (`WithProject = WithDB & { projectId: string }`). Per-module local aliases (e.g., `type BundleBase = WithProject`) keep call-site names readable without duplicating structure.

## 6. Pitfalls

| #   | Location                                                  | Status   | Issue                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## 7. Domain-Level Design Gaps

### 7-1. Two card→scope relationships are semantically distinct but not unified — ✅ Fixed

There are two independent paths by which a card relates to a scope:

- **Gathered**: `scope_rel (scopeId, cardId)` — an existing card is explicitly collected into a scope.
- **Originated**: `card.workingCopyId → working_copy.scopeId` — a card was created inside a working copy that belongs to a scope.

`createCardFromWorkingCopy` (see 7-2) resolves this by auto-inserting a `scope_rel` row at card creation time when the working copy has a live scope. "Originated" and "gathered" are therefore unified at the point of creation; `listCardsByScope` captures both without a UNION.

### 7-2. `card.bundleId NOT NULL` creates a hidden placement decision at creation time — ✅ Fixed

`src/db/api/composite.ts` exports `createCardFromWorkingCopy({ db, workingCopyId, bundleId, content })`. It encapsulates both concerns — working-copy context and bundle placement — in a single transactional call. `addCard` remains the low-level primitive for plain card creation.

### 7-3. Scope deletion creates a two-level orphan chain — ✅ Fixed

When a scope is deleted:

- `working_copy.scope_id → null` (orphan working copy — modeled)
- Cards born from that working copy still hold `workingCopyId` pointing to the now-orphaned working copy

`listCardsWithOrphanedWorkingCopy({ db })` in `working-copy.ts` surfaces the second level via an inner join on `working_copy.scope_id IS NULL`. Use it alongside `listOrphanedWorkingCopies` for full orphan-chain cleanup.

### 7-4. Multiple working copies per scope — intent is undefined

The schema allows N working copies per scope (`workingCopyRelations` uses `many`). Currently `working_copy` has only `id` and `scopeId`. If multiple working copies represent multiple users' workspaces, there is no `userId`. If they represent sessions, there is no timestamp or label. The distinction between working copies of the same scope is not modelable.

### 7-5. No snapshot of scope contents at working-copy creation time

When a working copy is created, only `scopeId` is stored. The set of cards gathered in the scope at that moment is not recorded. As cards are later added to or removed from `scope_rel`, the working copy's implied "view" shifts. Whether a working copy should be a **live window** (current state of scope) or a **frozen snapshot** (state at creation time) is an architectural decision the schema does not encode.

### 7-6. No reverse path: scope → contributing projects

`listCardsByScope` returns cards for a scope, but there is no query for "which projects or bundles contribute cards to this scope?" — it requires `scope_rel → card → bundle → project`, a multi-join not covered by any current API function.

---

## 8. Improvement Points

### Types / Interfaces — ✅ Applied

1. ~~Standardise the base context type~~ — `WithProject`, `WithBundle`, `WithScope` added to `api/types.ts`; all consumer files updated.
2. ~~Export `ScopeRel`~~ — `ScopeRel = InferSelectModel<typeof scopeRelTable>` added to `api/types.ts`.
3. ~~Fix the `withTx` type cast~~ — `db` is now typed; callback cast is narrowed to `fn as any` with a comment explaining `SQLiteTransaction` lacks `batch`. Public `Tx` type exported from `client.ts`.

### Implementations — ✅ Applied

4. ~~Typed `NotFoundError`~~ — `NotFoundError extends Error` added to `api/utils.ts`; `assertFound` throws it.
5. ~~Guard `drizzle.config.ts`~~ — `process.env.DATABASE_URL ?? 'file:./sqlite/local.db'` inline; `getDBURL` import removed.
6. **Wire `withTx` into multi-step operations.** `withTx` is correctly typed and available. No composite operations exist yet — apply when the first multi-table write is introduced.
7. ~~Add a composite `createCardFromWorkingCopy` function~~ — `composite.ts` exports `createCardFromWorkingCopy`; auto-inserts `scope_rel` when working copy has a live scope.

### Design — open

8. **Add attributes to `scope` and `working_copy`.** At minimum: a `createdAt` timestamp; optionally a `label` for scope and a `userId`/`ownerId` for working copy.
9. ~~Decide and document the gathered vs. originated relationship~~ — resolved by auto-insert in `createCardFromWorkingCopy`; `listCardsByScope` now covers both paths.
10. **Add scope → projects reverse query** as a convenience function.
